About email
-----------

Makahiki uses email in the following ways:

  * Players can elect to be "reminded" about activities they wish to attend.  Email is one communication option 
    provided.

  * Makahiki can automatically notify players via email if they have won a prize in the Top Score game
    or the Raffle Game after a round is over. 

.. todo:: Are there any other uses of email? Is it true that if email is not enabled, then
   these communication mechanisms will not be available? 

.. note:: Configuration of email for use in a Makahiki challenge is **optional**.  
   However, if you do not enable email, then these communication mechanisms will not be available to
   players and administrators.
